I currently work at Youku, Alibaba, where I lead several teams in overcoming challenges in the animation, film, and television industry by leveraging 3D and 2D generative techniques.

I got my Ph.D. from The University of Sydney (USYD) in 2019 under the guidance of [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html), with co-supervision from [Prof. Chaohui Wang](https://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~cwang/index.php) and [Prof. Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/). Prior to that, I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2014. 

Right now, I'm into researching 3D reconstruction/generation, NeRF, and image generation.
